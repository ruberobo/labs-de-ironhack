The founders' backgrounds are in science, energy, and data analysis and visualization.[1] Early employees include Christophe Viau, a Canadian software engineer and Ben Postlethwaite, a Canadian geophysicist.[2] Plotly was named one of the Top 20 Hottest Innovative Companies in Canada by the Canadian Innovation Exchange.[3] Plotly was featured in "startup row" at PyCon 2013,[4] and sponsored the SciPy 2018 conference.[5]
Plotly raised $5.5 million during its Series A funding, led by MHS Capital, Siemens Venture Capital, Rho Ventures, Real Ventures, and Silicon Valley Bank.[6]
The Boston Globe and Washington Post newsrooms have produced data journalism using Plotly.[7][8]

Plotly's main products include:

Dash is an open-source Python and R framework for building web-based analytic applications.[9]
Dash DAQ is an open-source package for building data acquisition GUIs to use with scientific instruments. It is built on Dash.[10]
Chart Studio has a graphical user interface for importing and analyzing data into a grid and using stats tools.[11] Graphs can be embedded or downloaded. Mainly used to make creating graphs faster and more efficient.
API libraries for Python,[12] R,[13] MATLAB,[14] Node.js,[15] Julia,[16] and Arduino[17] and a REST API.[18] Plotly can also be used to style interactive graphs with Jupyter notebook.[19]
