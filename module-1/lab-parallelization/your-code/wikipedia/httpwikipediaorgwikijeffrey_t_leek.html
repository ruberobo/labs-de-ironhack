Education[edit]
Leek graduated from Utah State University in 2003 with his Bachelors of Science. Then went on to study at the University of Washington achieving a Master's degree in 2005 and completed a PhD in Biostatistics in 2007 under the guidance of Prof. John D. Storey.[1]

Research and career[edit]
Leek joined Johns Hopkins University as an assistant professor in Biostatistics in 2009, working at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. In 2014 he became an associate professor in Biostatistics and Oncology.[6]
Leek works in The Center for Computational Biology[7] at Johns Hopkins University creating statistical packages[8][9] for analysis of genomes.
He also co-edits a blog, Simply Statistics[10] with Roger Peng and Rafa Irizarry, which contains a mix of articles on statistics and meta-research.[11]
Leek has conducted several talks at prestigious universities and locations such as a colloquium series at Harvard[12] and a lecture at the New York Genome Center titled “Building a Comprehensive Resource for the Study of Human Gene Expression with Machine Learning and Data Science”[13] as a part of their lecture series.
He is an expert in reproducibility, and his work and opinions have been published in notable scientific and medical journals such as Nature[14][15] and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Leek wrote a self-published book, The Elements of Data Analytic Style and is considered an expert on replication.[16][17]

Recognition[edit]
Leek was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association in 2020.[18]

Selected publications[edit]
Leek's highly cited works include 

"Capturing Heterogeneity in Gene Expression Studies by Surrogate Variable Analysis"[19]
"Tackling the Widespread and Critical Impact of Batch Effects in High-Throughput Data"[20]
