IMPORTANT NOTE: Most educators and professionals do not consider it appropriate to use tertiary sources such as encyclopedias as a sole source for any information—citing an encyclopedia as an important reference in footnotes or bibliographies may result in censure or a failing grade.   Wikipedia articles should be used for background information, as a reference for correct terminology and search terms, and as a starting point for further research.
As with any community-built reference, there is a possibility for error in Wikipedia's content—please check your facts against multiple sources and read our disclaimers for more information.

BibTeX entry

    author = "{Wikipedia contributors}",
    title = "Data science --- {Wikipedia}{,} The Free Encyclopedia",
    year = "2020",
    url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Data_science&oldid=973961803",
    note = "[Online; accessed 21-August-2020]"
  }

When using the LaTeX package url (\usepackage{url} somewhere in the preamble), which tends to give much more nicely formatted web addresses, the following may be preferred:

  @misc{ wiki:xxx,
    author = "{Wikipedia contributors}",
    title = "Data science --- {Wikipedia}{,} The Free Encyclopedia",
    year = "2020",
    howpublished = "\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Data_science&oldid=973961803}",
    note = "[Online; accessed 21-August-2020]"
  }
