History[edit]
Sisense was founded in 2004 in Tel Aviv by Elad Israeli, Eldad Farkash, Aviad Harell, Guy Boyangu and Adi Azaria.[8] The company worked in stealth mode on research and development until 2010, when initial investors, including Genesis Partners, Opus Capital and Eli Farkash, provided $4 million in Series A financing.[8][9]
Amit Bendov was appointed CEO in July 2012.[10] In April 2013, Sisense announced a $10 million series B funding round led by Battery Ventures, with participation from Genesis Partners and Opus Capital. In June 2014, new investor Draper Fisher Jurvetson Growth (DFJ Growth) led a $30 million series C funding round with participation from existing investors Battery Ventures, Genesis Partners and Opus Capital.[11][12]
In February 2013, as the first company in CrunchBase's "Developer Spotlight Program,"[1] Sisense analyzed 10 years of CrunchBase data in a public interactive investment dashboard dubbed CrunchAnalytics.[13] By analyzing a decade's worth of data about 100,000 companies, the dashboard provides the public with a research tool that enables users to query the data by different categories to see trends in investment over the past ten years.[1]
In 2015, Amir Orad was appointed CEO. Orad previously served as CEO of NICE Actimize.[14][15][16] In January 2016, the company announced a new $50 million funding round led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation by Battery Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Genesis Partners and Opus Capital.[17]
The company's software is used by companies in 49 countries.[3] Customers include Target.[18] In February 2018, the company was listed as a Visionary on the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms.[19]
In September 2018, the company announced another $80 million funding round led by Insight Venture Partners.[20]
In May 2019, Sisense acquired Periscope Data, creating a company with more than $120 million in annual recurring revenue, and over 900 employees. [21]
Finally, in January 2020, Sisense completed another round of funding at approximately $100m with a valuation exceeding $1b, cementing its status as a unicorn.  Sisense continues to operate in the data and analytics space with over 2500 customers.

Technology[edit]
In April 2013, Sisense introduced an alternative to in-memory technology called In-Chip analytics,[22] designed to maximize the disk, memory and CPU with resulting low latency.[6]
In May 2013, Sisense unveiled Prism 10X, which allows users to analyze 100 times more data at 10 times the speed of in-memory solutions. The company's In-Chip Analytics technology couples a columnar database with smart algorithms that use the in-chip cache, RAM or disk as needed instead of relying solely on RAM or disk.[23][24]
In October 2013, Sisense introduced Crowd Accelerated BI,[24] a technology that allows companies to scale users by providing faster query results as load increases and scale to thousands of simultaneous users on a single box.[25][26]
Each query is broken down to its basic components, which then helps the software decide which data to store on disk and which data to bring to memory. As more queries are cataloged, the software is able to more quickly recognize future similar queries and call up relevant data.[27]
In April 2017, Sisense introduced Sisense Pulse which provides alert when it detects results outside of normal parameters for a particular metric.[28]
