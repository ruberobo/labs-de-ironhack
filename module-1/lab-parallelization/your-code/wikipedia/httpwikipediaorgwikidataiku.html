History[edit]
In December 2018, Dataiku announced a $101 million Series C funding round led by ICONIQ Capital. This came hot on the heels of the release of Dataiku 5 in September 2018. In September 2019, the company was named to the Forbes Cloud 100, the definitive ranking of the top 100 private cloud companies in the world. 
In December 2019, just one day after the release of Dataiku 6, Dataiku announced that CapitalG - the late-stage growth venture capital fund financed by Alphabet Inc.- joined the company as an investor and that Dataiku had achieved unicorn status, valued at $1.4 billion.

Products[edit]
The software Dataiku Data Science Studio (DSS) was announced in 2014, supporting predictive modelling to build business applications.[1] Later versions of DSS added other features.[2]
Dataiku offers a free edition and enterprise versions with additional features, such as multi-user collaboration or real-time scoring.

Funding[edit]
In January 2015, Dataiku raised $3.6 million from Serena Capital and Alven Capital, two French technology venture capital funds.[1] This was followed by $14 million raised with FirstMark Capital, a New York City-based venture capital firm in October 2016.[3] In September 2017 the company raised a $28 million Series B investment from Battery Ventures, as well as historic investors.[4] In December 2018 Dataiku raised $101 million for data science platform. Among investors were Iconiq Capital, Alven Capital, Battery Ventures, Dawn Capital and FirstMark Capital.[5] In December 2019, CapitalG purchased some of the shares previously owned by Serena Capital in a secondary round that valued Dataiku at $1.4 billion.[6]
