== Foundations ==
Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from data sets, which are typically large (see [[big data]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.datascienceassn.org/about-data-science|title=About Data Science {{!}} Data Science Association|website=www.datascienceassn.org|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The field encompasses analysis, preparing data for analysis, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in an organization. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, mathematics, statistics, [[information visualization]], graphic design, [[complex systems]], [[communication]], [[buzzword bingo]] and business.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/doing-data-science/9781449363871/ch01.html|title=1.

===Relationship to statistics===
Many statisticians, including [[Nate Silver]], have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another name for statistics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statisticsviews.com/details/feature/5133141/Nate-Silver-What-I-need-from-statisticians.html|title=Nate Silver: What I need from statisticians - Statistics Views|website=www.statisticsviews.com|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Others argue that data science is distinct from statistics because it focuses on problems and techniques unique to digital data.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://priceonomics.com/whats-the-difference-between-data-science-and/|title=What's the Difference Between Data Science and Statistics?|website=Priceonomics|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> [[Vasant Dhar]] writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. In contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g. images) and emphasizes prediction and action.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DharVasant|date=2013-12-01|title=Data science and prediction|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=56|issue=12|pages=64–73|language=EN|doi=10.1145/2500499}}</ref> [[Andrew Gelman]] of Columbia University and data scientist Vincent Granville have described statistics as a nonessential part of data science.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2013/11/14/statistics-least-important-part-data-science/|title=Statistics is the least important part of data science « Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science|website=statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/data-science-without-statistics-is-possible-even-desirable|title=Data science without statistics is possible, even desirable|last=Posted by Vincent Granville on December 8|first=2014 at 5:00pm|last2=Blog|first2=View|website=www.datasciencecentral.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>
Stanford professor [[David Donoho]] writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing, and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<ref name=":7" /> 
In summary, data science can be therefore described as an applied branch of statistics.

== Etymology ==

=== Early usage ===

In 1962, [[John Tukey]] described a field he called “data analysis,” which resembles modern data science.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf|title=50 years of Data Science|last=Donoho|first=David|date=September 18, 2015|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref> Later, attendees at a 1992 statistics symposium at the [[Montpellier 2 University|University of Montpellier II]] acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on data of various origins and forms, combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Data science and its applications = La @science des données et ses applications|publisher=Academic Press/Harcourt Brace|others=Escoufier, Yves., Hayashi, Chikio (1918-....)., Fichet, Bernard.|year=1995|isbn=0-12-241770-4|location=Tokyo|pages=|oclc=489990740}}</ref><ref name="Murtagh 2018 14">{{Cite journal|last=Murtagh|first=Fionn|last2=Devlin|first2=Keith|date=2018|title=The Development of Data Science: Implications for Education, Employment, Research, and the Data Revolution for Sustainable Development|url=https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/2/2/14|journal=Big Data and Cognitive Computing|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=14|doi=10.3390/bdcc2020014|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The term “data science” has been traced back to 1974, when [[Peter Naur]] proposed it as an alternative name for computer science.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=CaoLongbing|date=2017-06-29|title=Data Science|journal=ACM Computing Surveys|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1–42|language=EN|doi=10.1145/3076253|doi-access=free}}</ref> In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.<ref name=":0" /> However, the definition was still in flux. In 1997, [[C.F. Jeff Wu]] suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting, or limited to describing data.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf|title=Statistics=Data Science?|last=Wu|first=C.F. Jeff|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref> In 1998, Chikio Hayashi argued for data science as a new, interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis.<ref name="Murtagh 2018 14"/>

During the 1990s, popular terms for the process of finding patterns in datasets (which were increasingly large) included “knowledge discovery” and “data mining.”<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/05/28/a-very-short-history-of-data-science/|title=A Very Short History Of Data Science|last=Press|first=Gil|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

=== Modern usage ===
The modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed to [[William S. Cleveland]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~wsc/|title=William S Cleveland|last=Gupta|first=Shanti|date=December 11, 2015|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref> In a 2001 paper, he advocated an expansion of statistics beyond theory into technical areas; because this would significantly change the field, it warranted a new name.<ref name=":1" /> "Data science" became more widely used in the next few years: in 2002, the [[Committee on Data for Science and Technology]] launched ''Data Science Journal.'' In 2003, Columbia University launched ''The Journal of Data Science''.<ref name=":1" /> In 2014, the [[American Statistical Association]]'s Section on Statistical Learning and Data Mining changed its name to the Section on Statistical Learning and Data Science, reflecting the ascendant popularity of data science.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Talley|first=Jill|url=https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2016/06/01/datascience-2/|title=ASA Expands Scope, Outreach to Foster Growth, Collaboration in Data Science|date=June 1, 2016|work=Amstat News|access-date=|url-status=live|publisher=American Statistical Association}}</ref>

The professional title of “data scientist” has been attributed to [[DJ Patil]] and [[Jeff Hammerbacher]] in 2008.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Davenport|first=Thomas H.|url=https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century|title=Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century|date=2012-10-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2020-04-03|last2=Patil|first2=D. J.|issue=October 2012|issn=0017-8012}}</ref> Though it was used by the [[National Science Board]] in their 2005 report, "Long-Lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century," it referred broadly to any key role in managing a digital data collection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2005/nsb0540/|title=US NSF - NSB-05-40, Long-Lived Digital Data Collections Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>

There is still no consensus on the definition of data science and it is considered by some to be a buzzword.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/08/19/data-science-whats-the-half-life-of-a-buzzword/|title=Data Science: What's The Half-Life Of A Buzzword?|last=Press|first=Gil|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>

== Careers in data science ==
Data science is a growing field. A career as a data scientist is ranked at the third best job in America for 2020 by Glassdoor, and was ranked the number one best job from 2016-2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.glassdoor.com/List/Best-Jobs-in-America-LST_KQ0,20.htm|title=Best Jobs in America|website=Glassdoor|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>

=== Educational path ===
In order to become a data scientist, there is a significant amount of education and experience required. The first step in becoming a data scientist is to earn a bachelor's degree, typically in a quantitative field.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mastersindatascience.org/careers/data-scientist/|title=What is a Data Scientist?|website=Master's in Data Science|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Coding bootcamps are also available and can be used as an alternate pre-qualification to supplement a bachelor's degree.<ref name=":3" /> Most data scientists also complete a master’s degree or a PhD in a quantitative/scientific field.<ref name=":3" /> Once these qualifications are met, the next step to becoming a data scientist is to apply for an entry-level job in the field.<ref name=":3" /> Some data scientists may later choose to specialize in a sub-field of data science.<ref name=":3" />
