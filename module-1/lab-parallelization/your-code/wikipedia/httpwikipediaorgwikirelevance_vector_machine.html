In mathematics, a Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is a machine learning technique that uses Bayesian inference to obtain parsimonious solutions for regression and probabilistic classification.[1]
The RVM has an identical functional form to the support vector machine, but provides probabilistic classification.
It is actually equivalent to a Gaussian process model with covariance function:

{\displaystyle k(\mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {x'} )=\sum _{j=1}^{N}{\frac {1}{\alpha _{j}}}\varphi (\mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {x} _{j})\varphi (\mathbf {x} ',\mathbf {x} _{j})}


where 



φ


{\displaystyle \varphi }

 is the kernel function (usually Gaussian),

{\displaystyle \alpha _{j}}

 are the variances of the prior on the weight vector

, and

{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {x} _{N}}

 are the input vectors of the training set.[2]
Compared to that of support vector machines (SVM), the Bayesian formulation of the RVM avoids the set of free parameters of the SVM (that usually require cross-validation-based post-optimizations). However RVMs use an expectation maximization (EM)-like learning method and are therefore at risk of local minima. This is unlike the standard sequential minimal optimization (SMO)-based algorithms employed by SVMs, which are guaranteed to find a global optimum (of the convex problem).
The relevance vector machine is patented in the United States by Microsoft (patent expired September 4, 2019).[3]
