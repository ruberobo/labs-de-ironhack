General[edit]
Power BI provides cloud-based BI (business intelligence) services, known as "Power BI Services", along with a desktop based interface, called "Power BI Desktop". It offers data warehouse capabilities including data preparation, data discovery and interactive dashboards.[2]
In March 2016, Microsoft released an additional service called Power BI Embedded on its Azure cloud platform.[3] One main differentiator of the product is the ability to load custom visualizations.

History[edit]
This application was originally conceived by Thierry D'Hers and Amir Netz of the SQL Server Reporting Services Team at Microsoft.[4]  It was originally designed by Ron George in the summer of 2010 and named Project Crescent.[5]  Project Crescent was initially available for public download on July 11, 2011 bundled with SQL Server Codename Denali.[6]  Later renamed to Power BI it was then unveiled by Microsoft in September 2013 as Power BI for Office 365.[7]  The first release of Power BI was based on the Microsoft Excel–based add-ins: Power Query, Power Pivot and Power View. With time, Microsoft also added many additional features like Question and Answers, enterprise level data connectivity and security options via Power BI Gateways.[2] Power BI was first released to the general public on July 24, 2015.[8]
In February 2019, Gartner confirmed Microsoft as Leader in the "2019 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platform" as a result of the capabilities of Power BI platform.[9] This represented the 12th consecutive year of recognition of Microsoft as Leading vendor in this Magic Quadrant category (beginning 3 years before this tool was even created).[10]
