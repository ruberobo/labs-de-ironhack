ACM Turing AwardStephen Kettle's slate statue of Alan Turing at Bletchley ParkAwarded forOutstanding contributions in computer scienceCountryUnited StatesPresented byAssociation for Computing Machinery (ACM)Reward(s)US $1,000,000[1]First awarded1966; 54 years ago (1966)Last awarded2019Websiteamturing.acm.org
The ACM A. M. Turing Award is an annual prize given by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for contributions "of lasting and major technical importance to the computer field".[2] It is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science, or the "Nobel Prize of Computing".[3][4][5][6]
The award is named after Alan Turing, who was a British mathematician and reader in mathematics at the University of Manchester. Turing is often credited as being the key founder of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.[7] From 2007 to 2013, the award was accompanied by an additional prize of US$250,000, with financial support provided by Intel and Google.[2] Since 2014, the award has been accompanied by a prize of US$1 million, with financial support provided by Google.[1][8]
The first recipient, in 1966, was Alan Perlis, of Carnegie Mellon University. The first female recipient was Frances E. Allen of IBM in 2006.[9]

Alan Perlis



For his influence in the area of advanced computer programming techniques and compiler construction.[10]

Wilkes is best known as the builder and designer of the EDSAC, the first computer with an internally stored program. Built in 1949, the EDSAC used a mercury delay line memory. He is also known as the author, with Wheeler and Gill, of a volume on "Preparation of Programs for Electronic Digital Computers" in 1951, in which program libraries were effectively introduced.[11]


1968

For his work on numerical methods, automatic coding systems, and error-detecting and error-correcting codes.[12]


1969

Marvin Minsky



For his central role in creating, shaping, promoting, and advancing the field of artificial intelligence.[13]


1970

Edsger Dijkstra was a principal contributor in the late 1950s to the development of the ALGOL, a high level programming language which has become a model of clarity and mathematical rigor. He is one of the principal proponents of the science and art of programming languages in general, and has greatly contributed to our understanding of their structure, representation, and implementation. His fifteen years of publications extend from theoretical articles on graph theory to basic manuals, expository texts, and philosophical contemplations in the field of programming languages.[16]


1973

Charles Bachman



For his outstanding contributions to database technology.[17]


1974

In joint scientific efforts extending over twenty years, initially in collaboration with J. C. Shaw at the RAND Corporation, and subsequently with numerous faculty and student colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University, they have made basic contributions to artificial intelligence, the psychology of human cognition, and list processing.[19]


Herbert A. Simon




1976

Michael O. Rabin



For their joint paper "Finite Automata and Their Decision Problem,"[20] which introduced the idea of nondeterministic machines, which has proved to be an enormously valuable concept.
