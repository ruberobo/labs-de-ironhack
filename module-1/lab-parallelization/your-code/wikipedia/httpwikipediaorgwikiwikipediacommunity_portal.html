WikiProjects and Task Forces
The Wikipedia Help Project seeks assistance expanding and improving the Task Center and other pages within the Help namespace.
WikiProject Abandoned Drafts Stale draft drive. An ongoing drive dedicated to reducing the amount of stale user space drafts. Options are to delete, redirect, move to mainspace or blank. Stop by and help the drive out!
WikiProject Spoken Wikipedia is looking for people who are interested in helping out in our project to get our articles into an audio format that can be used for any number of uses including, but not limited to, visually impaired or people who just prefer to listen to the article instead of reading it for whatever reason they choose. You can sign up here on our participant's page. We are also in need of people who speak other languages so that the proper pronunciation of words can be properly spoken. You can sign up for the Pronunciation task force by adding your name to section 2 as well as the languages you are fluent in.
Wikiproject/Group editing activities and efforts
May–June
Houston Online Wikipedia Edit-a-thon Series. These virtual edit-a-thons on Zoom will focus on Houston women artists. We will provide tutorials for the beginner Wikipedian, reference materials, and encouragement. Sign up at houstonwiki.eventbrite.com to receive the Zoom link. Participants will be able to ask questions throughout and are not required to stay for the entire session.
Platform: Zoom (link will be sent an hour before the event)
 Women in Red Project: Reducing gender imbalance. Improve coverage of women in countries where they are poorly represented either on the English Wikipedia and/or in those where serious imbalances exist between the sexes. We have tried to cover countries in all the continents, as you will see from the lists at the page for this project. We have used two sources: List of gender imbalance per country by number of biographies on the English Wikipedia; and the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2020, especially Table 1 showing "The Global Gender Gap Index 2020 rankings".
Wikipedia:WikiProject Black Lives Matter/June 2020: "Wikipedia wants YOUR help to improve our coverage of Black Lives Matter and related topics! For the entire month of June 2020, we are holding the Black Lives Matter article improvement drive, a collaborative effort to improve our articles on topics relating to racism, racialized violence, and the African diaspora more widely.
Ongoing
The 100,000 Challenge. The quest to bring about 100,000 article improvements and creations globally through a series of 50,000/10,000/1000 Challenges for different regions and countries. This is a loose challenge, a list will not be maintained here, but the components will function independently on each of the subpages. Will be updated every week or two.
The 50,000 Destubbing Challenge is a long term challenge to destub 50,000 articles on English Wikipedia for every country and topic. It began on March 1, 2020 with the Wikipedia:The Great Britain/Ireland Destubathon and opened as a global editathon on March 31. It may take decades to accomplish, it may take ten years, it all depends on how many people actively contribute. A long term framework which will hopefully be sped up by running  There are more than 3,300,000 stub articles on the English Wikipedia, more than half of our articles. It needs to be drastically reduced somehow! Ideally we need a 1 million Destubbing Challenge!
The Summer World Destubbing Challenge is taking place between May 1 and July 31, 2020.
Page used for announcements towards the community members of the project
Wikipedia:WikiCup. The WikiCup is a championship that has taken place every year on Wikipedia since 2007. The Cup is played and won by skill of editing. The purpose of the Cup is to encourage content creation and improvement and make editing on Wikipedia more fun. There is a new round every month, until the current contest ends; below are the details.
May 1 to June 28 – 32 contestants left.
July 1 to August 29 – 16 contestants left.
September 1 to October 31 – 8 finalists left, the contestant with the highest score will win!
Women in Red: #1day1woman | 2020. For anyone interested in creating or improving articles on women and their works outside the specific focus of our monthly editathons. We have called it #1day1woman as the label can be used worldwide on the social media, creating new trends of interest. Perfectionists might like to create a new article each and every day but one new article on any one day will be the starting point. This is an opportunity for our members and all other editors to create or improve articles on women who are notable in any field.
The virtual edit-a-thon allows enthusiasts from around the globe to participate in the work.
The lists of redlinks should provide inspiration.
There is a section where you can list the articles you create this month, and another section where you can add the images you uploaded to Commons.
This essay on creating women's biographies and our Ten Simple Rules might be helpful to newcomers.

Tip of the day


Tip of the day...

How reliable is Wikipedia?
It is pretty good, and getting better.  But...
...it is inappropriate to cite Wikipedia as a source, because it is updated in real time.  So from the time you cite a Wikipedia page to the time another person looks up your citation, the page may have changed.  Citations are usually only applicable to static publications that do not change once they are published.  Wikipedia is not a static publication, it is dynamic!‍—‌it changes every minute.  In this sense, Wikipedia is not a reliable citable source.  
How reliable is Wikipedia as a general resource?  Very reliable.  Most of the content on Wikipedia is accurate, and many subjects are updated faster than the news.  But, Wikipedia is subject to being edited by almost anyone and any time, and the edits may be biased, out of date, incorrect, or malicious (vandalism).  Therefore, it is advisable to double-check what you learn in Wikipedia against other sources.
Keep in mind that many volunteers monitor Wikipedia for errors.  Since there are so many people reading the articles and monitoring contributions using the Recent Changes page, and using watchlists, incorrect information is usually spotted and corrected quickly. 
Some argue that new errors are also introduced all the time, so that the overall accuracy rate is not really improving. Nevertheless, by encouraging people to help with correcting articles, validating content, and providing useful references, errors will eventually be greatly reduced.
The more accurate Wikipedia becomes, the more it attracts additional contributors. It is a self-reinforcing cycle!
